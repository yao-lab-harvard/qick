Hello! Welcome to the QICK quick start guide pages! 

Depending on your board, you will follow a different quick start guide.

If your board is the ZCU111, follow [this guide](https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/blob/main/quick_start/README_ZCU111.md). 

If your board is the ZCU216, follow [this guide](https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/blob/main/quick_start/README_ZCU216.md). 

If your board is the RFSoC4x2, we don't have a dedicated guide, but you should be able to follow a combination of the 4x2's setup instructions (for basic power and connectivity) and our ZCU111 guide (for flashing an SD card image and installing QICK).

Enjoy!
